Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to create a client using React.
Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
Build a React form for users to create posts, however i ran our of time getting it to work.
I created multiple pages using React Router.
Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.
SQL to retrieve posts from the database in my Express server.
Display all posts using .map().
Create dynamic pages using react-router-dom.


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
This weeks assignment have been a bit of rollercoster

I got my database working fine at the start but then realised i needed to add a username, so i went back to edit, that was where it all went wrong. I retrieved the last git data but and ran it again bout i encountered a couple of errors because of this i was not able to add/delete a post.

I was able to create the new form for the user to add data and also mimi a json on the client side to test my app, this works ok I could see the form data in my console. But when i connected it to my server i was getting a lot of error (one of which : Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')).
Due to the vast amount of time i spent debugging i was unable to style my assignment unfortunately.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I particularly found it hard was using CRUD in relational database table.
